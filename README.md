# Smart FileFlow (v1.1)

Smart FileFlow is a premium, responsive cross-platform file organizer utility built using Python, Kivy, and KivyMD. Designed with a custom modern **Sleek Dark Mode** interface, it allows users to scan directories, view live dry-run previews of proposed moves, categorize files by their extensions, and organize them into standard folders with full **Undo** transaction support.

The application is fully optimized to run on both **Desktop** (Windows, macOS, Linux) and **Android devices** (targeting Android 13+ / API 34).

## ✨ Features

- **Obsidian Dark Theme**: A visually striking UI styled in deep charcoal (`#121620`) with neon cyan and gradient accents.
- **Dynamic File Scanning**: Automatically groups files into categories: `Images`, `Videos`, `Documents`, `Audio`, `Archives`, `Installers`, and `Others`.
- **One-Tap Quick Shortcuts**: Fast-click cards to instantly access common Android folders (Downloads, Pictures, Documents, Music) with built-in existence checks.
- **Dry-Run Preview**: A scrollable preview pane that displays proposed paths (`[Filename] ➔ [Category]/[Filename]`) before committing the changes.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart renaming logic (e.g., `photo_1.jpg`) to prevent file collisions during organization.
- **Undo last Run**: Transaction history logs allow the user to revert the last organization run instantly, returning files to their original paths.
- **Android Scoped Storage Bridge**: Full support for Android 11+ All Files Access (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) permissions using a Java bridge (`pyjnius`).
- **Lazy Dialog Initializer**: Deferral of complex UI widget constructions until requested, protecting the app from launch-time OpenGL context crashes on Android.
- **Automated Tests**: Unit test suite verifying scanner classification, renaming, dry-run mapping, and undo systems.
